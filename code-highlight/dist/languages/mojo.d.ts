/**
 * Mojo grammar.
 *
 * highlight.js does not ship a Mojo grammar and there is no community package
 * for it (the only upstream "mojo" grammar is the unrelated Perl Mojolicious
 * framework). We build one here. Mojo is a superset of Python, so we start from
 * the bundled Python grammar and layer on the extra keywords, argument-convention
 * modifiers, and standard-library types that Mojo adds. The keyword and type
 * lists mirror Modular's official TextMate grammar (github.com/modular/mojo-syntax).
 *
 * As with our custom Python grammar, we also colour call sites as function
 * titles so that API snippets, which are mostly method calls, do not render as a
 * wall of unstyled grey text.
